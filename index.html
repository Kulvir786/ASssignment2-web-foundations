    <h1>Welcome to my site.<br>Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>
    <p>I started this web site because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. 
    	But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, 
    	and they've become quite a hit.<br><br>
       If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, 
    	stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on 
    	all things Halloween.</p>
